Do not give anybody advice, cox that, anyway, they never listen.

> You all, absolutely understand all these words I said. People are not asleep. They FAKE sleeping.

Freedom and liberty are not on the other side of the river, they in the peak of highland.

What is the liberty? The liberty is the collection of rights.

Freedom is not a kind of existence in jenseitigkeit but a phenomenon **in this word**. Everyone is born in freedom, however, this world is filled of shackles of limits and restrictions to humman being, which is the nature of freedom.

In Jurisprudence we call the free liberty, not the philosophical term, freedom, which is the revolution to necessity.

The **People** CREATES the history.

Is history nonexistent or is it just the hallucination of people-struggling? Or the People is in nihility, they are nothing more than the fuel to advance of the history.

> War on the German state of affairs!  
> By all means!

Marx cried (A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right Introduction). But had people taken his advising? The whole Germany had been drunk in nation-Chauvinism of Prussian aquavit!

Because the all histories since recorded are the histories of class-struggle, there, all the ubiquitous agony rlued-class suffered and some occational sadness rluing-class encountered, is absolute fruit from their insufficient struggling power.

The right, or liberty,does not grown in the terra, nor falling from the ethers. It can not idle to the front of you by legs and as well as it can not flutter into your arms by wings. And no Messaiah will save you without you own struggle. You shall STRUGGLE for your liberty BY YOURSELF. Liberty only cares thoes who enchants it in action not those who claims to love liberty in speaking.

But, de facto, Only a few prefer liberty, the majority seek nothing more than a just dominator!(Sallust)

You shall know that, for the tyrant, all the richness and sumptuousness of his life were constructed over the sacrifice by you the exploitation and oppression to **you**, the People!

For that imagination the exploiter and exploitee hands in hands sibilingly is impossible, to dream a fantasy that someday the monarch were to pay mercy to plebeian is as well as childish and impracticable!

The monarch never regards people as individuals. He takes them as his servants or slaves, as the lambs need his lead, as the resource to implement his own epic reveries!
