*narrated by Ruhuang(如皇), the chancellor of Zuixiang Empire*

About ten thousand years ago, it is the first time our Empress to create the human being. She made them by earth, taught them hunting, clothing, cropping and finally the writing.

She has the ability to connect with anybody by their dreams. Thus people admired and grantedly named her "Ultrasomnia(极梦真君)". Under her bless and auxilia, people built numerous magnificent cities, buildings and even three colonies beyond the land.

Seeing so prosperous people had got, Ultrasomnia contented and decided to let them develop by themselves. And after created this world, the lands, mares, mountains, plants, animals, birds, insects and finally the human being, her divine power needed to recover and reflesh.

Then she demanded that the people dedicate to her a temple on the highest peak, and that she dormite there. She summoned the king of the people before her and told him that "I will take this place as my holy accommodation in your mortal-land. And when I recover myself this place shall be sacred, which will make here unreachable for any mortals including you, whom I chose from people as my humible servant and the king of the mortals. However, in case of some malicious events that perhaps happen in the future, I shall enlight you intuiting that -- even in a long dream, I still could protect and affiliate you. I, who will be dormant in this temple, am supposed to prevent you and your people from pyrofire, deluge, earthquake, war, famine, plague or anything severe fatal to your fragile mortal bodies -- as long as you and your people keep obedient and dedicating to me."

The king bowed himself in front of Ultrasomnia, and sweared to her that he and his people, generations by generations, were going to keep mediocre and dedicating to her in perpetuity. then he declared that from then on "I  corroborate these below as supreme law -- the one who moves forth to this holy place without permission shall be decollated; the one who maledicts or mistrusts Ultrasomnia shall be blinded and removed tongue; the one who rejects to dedicate to Ultrasomnia in deliberate sense, shall be exiled for twenty years; and forgets, ten years; the one who direspects the image, the picture of Ultrasomnia or the characters of her name, shall be hand-cut; and the one who wants to change or abolish this law, shall be regarded ad the public enemy and all the people shall kill him by all means."

Rejoiced after listenned these laws the king just made, Ultrasomnia said "It is commendable. And to that it has visualized your humible obedience and sincere servity. To bless you, I grant you a long duration of liveng life, in order to rule your people and serve me better and better. "

The king rendered his gratias to Ultrasomnia. Then she fell into a long sleep. And the king blocks this temple, then claimed the whole moutain as the holy moutain. Then he commands all the people who lived near this moutain to leave their old casas dand find new residential place far there. Only allocate a few of sacerdoses who has responsibly to clean the temple and to offer royal tributions every day. On every calends and ides, the king offered by himself. He also appointed and deployed a royal squadron surrounding the holy moutain, researching and catching everybody who stepped into this sacred area. And this poor guy would be decapitated on a raucous day at the capital city in public, even if without a deliberate intention. All the people founded a statue or a picture of Ultrasomnia. They admired and offered to the statue or picture every single day. All the people gathered in front of the foot of the holy moutain to festival showing  gratias to Ultrasomnia on her blessing and protecting.

One thousand years after, on an overhistorically significant new-year festival, Ultrasomnia woke. She praised the servity and the obedience of the king -- who enjoyed the age more than one thousand -- and the people. She donated them many treasure and she also granted the sons of the king long-live capability.

Ultrasomnia spent of the month received the admiration from people. And in the end , the king held a solemn ceremony for her second sleeping. When the ceremony coming to the terminal, the king asked a request to Ultrasomnia for becoming her hand-slave or something else that could accompany with her every hour. She allowed then took him together  into the temple and transformed him into a pair of socks by her power, then wore.

The eldest son of the king enthroned as the new king, appellated as "Supermox" king(傲世王) continued lead the people and admiring Ultrasomnia.

Supermox King is an ambitious but amiable ruler. In the second millenary, he expanded the scale of the state and these colonies, urged and subsidized the innovation and improvement of various aspects: agriculture, architecture, technology, literature and art. He always emphasized that "The  happiness and peace of all people who are my subjects and all the successes of my reignnance, shall be attributed to our admiration and obedience to Ultrasomnia. She is ALL to us." When Ultrasomnia came awake second Supermox oganized a more imposing festival to welcome her. She did something generous as the last time. Due to the persuading of Supermox, she stayed three monthse this time. And when she were about to sleep again, the king projected a similiar appeal as his father's.

"My dear goddess, I am long for that you could accompany with me every day and forever. I can not endure that continual loneliness in the tedious thousand years." Ultrasomnia accepted his request and prepared to make him into her pillow. However, the king refused.

"No, my dear goddess," he inquit, "I don't wanna become an obscure, pillow, socks or something ceterum. I wanna YOU. I wanna you marry me. I wanna you becoming my wife, my consort-queen, living with me every single second and hour and to make as many royal issues with me."

A few seconds paused, Ultrasomnia thurdered "You humible mortal creature from earth and ash, how dare you, a tiny, fragile and dirty brute, just as a worm or *gusano* to me, have such miserable imprudence and culpable impudicity to propose a felonious offense as this? You have committed the sin of arrogance. You shall be penitent in the next millanny!" After this, she came back to the temple and slept.

From that day on, the king became listless and inflammable. He didn't call on the state council anymore and let the public affairs aside. He consoled himself watching these statues and pictures of Ultrasomnia. And he drunk excessedly day and night. He even wanted to commit a suicide but not, only for counting on the next rewake of Ultrasomnia.

At that season, after a ten-year ostracism, a former sacerdos, who had gotten a banishment on forgetting to dedicating offer to Ultrasomnia, came back to the common street. During his long time exile -- or speaking travelling -- had accumulated adequate knowledgement and  thereas became a skilful magician, and maybe the first magician in history, mastering considerable incredible magical power. He even invented a new character -- nowadays called "Runes(符文)" to release different magic effect and also record his archievement. He called himself "Rubraco(赤蛟)". Learning the story of Supermox, he went to the capital city, the royal palace and to beg providing the king.

Before the king, Rubraco said that he could dissolve the crux of the king.

"No one could dissolve my crux," said the king, "except the goddess herself." drunk a bit and prepared dismiss the magician.

"Atque I can." the magician insisted. Then he displayed his runes magic to tell the king that he had invented a ceremony which can sway and reversal the mind of the goddess perpetually, after which the goddess, who was the creator of this world, would become an obedient little woman to the king. "She will not ignore nor neglect you anymore. She just IS your affectionate wife, your loyal *esposa mulier*. She makes babies as many as you want. Her petite brain desires *nihil* but your amor and petting -- just after a subtle ceremony, Your Majesty."

Those fantastic words in his magically magnetic soud had stroken the king's mind and sense. Paused a considerable long silence, he yielded.

Then Supermox appointed Rubraco as his "Secretary of State(国师)", and threw the kitchen sink on that ceremony. He conscripted innumerable plebians to build five terraces near the holy moutain in different directions. And the ceremony also acquired abundant rare treatures range from organs of mythical animals to legendary herbs over the sea and moutain into which human had never reached. The king conducted all the power he possessed , from plebian to army, main urbes, towns, villages and those colonies, to collect those precious stuffs.

Supermox recovered his energitic status he used to have, notwithstanding went to cruel, inhumane and mad... In order to accelerate the progress of those ceremonic platforms, he enslaved many common people, even including the ageds, children and pregnants, to work neglecting the hour. He exiled those noblemen, chancellors and local officers who appealled mercy on those people suffered increasing labor. He killed anybody whom was catchen by his military fleeing from his conscription. And he liked executing them by himself. And he also buried alive a respectable poet who had wrote an irony satire on his madness of the ceremony Rubraco planned.

During that three years they constructing that platforms, Supermox adapted every words of his Secretary of State, did anything for his demands aiming that ceremony. For convenience, he mandated him to appoint government officers and court chancellors. But he didn't perceive the inner true plan of his Secretary of State, this former banished sacerdos.

With these terraces approaching completed, Supermox became more and more fierce. One day, a colony was late just a bit on delivering those corns of non-winged unicorns. The king stormly insulted and blamed the governess of that colony. And in public, he cut the hands of this lady who was his half-blood sister. Although he did his best preparing that ceremony, a special acquired stuff haunting him always. That is "heart and blood of a -- traitor". Rubraco just said to wait patiently.

Soon, a revolution rose, led by the younger brother of the incumbent king. He entitled himself "General of Recover", the the governors gathered to help him and many people suffered poverty and agonance conjungated themselves with the revolution. The king delighted, for he could get enough  heart and blood from his full-blood brother, who was a true traitor in his eyes. However, his men were frustrated again and again at battleground. No more that three monthes since the revolution broke out, the king had lost almost half of territory and those colonies cut down the supply and blocked the sea of his kingdom. Then his Secretary of State conveyed him a consulium, an absolutely dirty trick.

Supermox released a public declaration demonstrating that: He had no intention to kill or battle with his full-blood btrother. And the war had casted a monsterous catastrophe unpon his people which made him in deep grief. He loved his brother and cared his people, therefore to avoid a bigger disater if the war continue, he asked for a peaceful conference to make a treaty ending this unnecessary war. 

Despite many consuls and his siblings were against this asking,the General accepted. Supermox, just arranging a few men along him, attended this conference held in the land of the revolution. The two brother met, greeted and hugged warmly which made all people attending to see a dawn of the peace. but to their atonishment and surprise, the  king chopped his brother's abdomen when they in hug and stratched his still-tremble heart by his hand. His men, they were followers of Rubraco, before the General's stunned guards react to bark, spelt a magic and teleported them disappearing in flush, leaving those people in chaos and scary. The king returned to his palace with those magicain -- and the heart and blood of his own brother.

The rebelling strength got into trouble disputing the leadership of the whole revolution. They were not a solidary might anymore. They attacked and surprised each other often. The king enjoyed this picture and saw his promising future: the husband of the goddess who created this world.

That future is just a fabricate illusion to him. The last night before that ceremony, Supermox was assassinated by Rubraco and his followers. This is the true schedule of Rubraco. It is HIM, not the Supermox, whom he was going to make the husband of Ultrasomnia. And by mastering the goddess and dominating her divine power, he will become the god de facto in this world. In his routine, Supermox the infatuated king is nothing but a piece of chess, a tool to reach his ultra aim.

As we all known, he failed. But the detail is hazy, because that the story above is reiterated after the remaining fragments of the personal notes of Rubraco. He recorded this in runes and casted magic upon it so the weather and ages does no effect on it. It is reasonable he cannot record his terminal because obviously he got annihiliation at that scene.

The following outline is resorted and reconstructed by us from the ancient folk tale of OUR ANCESTORY.

For the disobedience, disgrace, degeneration and arrogance of the Old eon people, Ultrasomnia raged her wrath and "recleaned" the world by volcanos, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, famine, epidemics etc. Population shriked, culture and technology regressed, cities and buildings fell into exitium and ruins.

In this time, she created years after. Her wrath colded down and decided on a new creation. In this time, she created the "New eon human being", ie. us, the populus here. Then she wrapped our land with strong fog and named our state Zuixiang, means "in deep dream". We dedicated her a new temple. We admire and offer to her. She will not allow a mortal king to rule us. Instead, she becomes our empress directly rules us by dream connection.

Under her bless, we keep our obedience and she donates us many treature by which we do trade with other countries. She also prevents us from natural disater, epidemic, starvery and rebellion. This is why our country flourish so beautiful, peaceful, powerful and sumptuously wealthy.

We admire Ultrasomnia since our coutry estalishment three thousand years ago and so as today. And it lasts forever.
