青年人对政治的漠不关心往往是民主衰落的开端。我听见有年轻人说，无论是君主制还是共和制都与他们的生活毫无关系；这个国家是否被一个国王统治，对他们没有影响。我的天呐，他们真的知道国王到底是什么东西么？他们以为君主制是什么？难道只是王冠，只是黄袍，只是权杖，只是屈膝礼吗？多么天真啊-- 君主就其本质而言，都是吃人的怪物。**哪里有君主，哪里就没有自由！**

君主要完全吞噬你，包括你的灵魂，他/她要把你的身体分割成碎片，每一片都永远受其支配；还要把国家当作他/她的私有财产，你们都要当他的走狗，连同你们的父母妻儿也要永远受他凌辱！只有最卑贱、自甘为奴的民族才适合被君主统治。

我们这个追求自由的民族必要誓死捍卫共和。

The commence of the decline of a democracy usually is the indifference on the politics from the adolescents. I have heard some young men said, whether a king rules the country does not make any influence on their daily life. Pro, did they ever know what is a king? Just a crown, a purple robe, ascepter or the bow and curtsey? How much childish. A monarch, on its nature, is a devil devouring people. *Ubi tyrannus est, ibi nulla libertas!*
 
The monarch wants to devour thy and your soul completely. S/he divides your body into pieces and each ones should be subjected to him/her forever. And S/he would take the country as its private belongings. You all have to be ist slave and it would bully and humiliate your parents, spouse and children, eternally. Only those most servile folks match the monarchy ruling.

We, the people who chase the freedom, must defend the republic, by all means!
