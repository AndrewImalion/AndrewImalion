五年前，我对我的犬儒朋友们说“放弃自由寻求安全的人，既得不到安全，也放弃了自由。”他们说我读书读傻了，谁当leader都影响不了老百姓生活。“谁当leader都影响不了老百姓生活”是我近三十年人生听到最多的political冷漠话术之一，因为并不能奢望所有人都和我们一样学过历史，其实那对底层人民的冲击却是最大的。毕竟贵族老爷们不用去修大运河，元老院的optimas也不可能饿肚子。但是，我们国人历来就喜欢圣君明主，萨鲁斯特曰“只有极少数人热爱自由，大部分人只想要英明的主子。”，那他们的结局就势必如普鲁塔克言“...那些为攫取权力之人贿赂人民的小恩小惠，得权后要加倍从人民手中夺走。”“迷信神仙皇帝救世主之人，最终要沦为奴隶、羔羊和祭品。”有什么样的人民就有什么样的国家，人民是历史的创造者，那么理所当然，人民必须承受自己选择的苦难。

当我身边那些曾经为英伯拉多大唱赞歌的人也开始说“事情在慢慢起变化”的时候，我说“你们选的，不是说对老百姓没影响吗？而且，这才哪到哪，好日子还在后头呢！”，但他只会说“上面的本意是好的，下面执行坏了。”然后就是些什么有心之人啊，恶意利用啊，罕见个案啊之类令人作呕的话语。这些人，如提比略所言“真是奴才”（2022 Nov.22）

Five years ago, I said to my cynical friends, "Those who give up their freedom to seek security will not only get security, but also give up their freedom. They said I was stupid cox deeply reading, and that whoever became the leader could not affect the lives of the people. "Whoever becomes leader can not affect the lives of the people" is one of the most political indifferent words I have heard in my nearly thirty years of life, because I can not expect everyone to learn history as we did, in fact, that the impact on the bottom-class people is the greatest. After all, the noble lords do not have to repair the Grand Canal, the senate optimas are not likely to starve. However, our countrymen have always been fond of messiahs and domini iusti, Sallust said "only a few people love freedom, most people only want a wise master." Then they are bound to end up as Plutarch said, "... The little buns that tyrants bribe the people in order to seize power, after gaining power, will be doubly taken away from the people. "Those who superstitiously loong for the messiah, the imperator and domini iusti, definitely degenerate into slaves, lambs and sacrifices." What kind of people they are, what kind of country they get. And the people are the creators of history, so it stands to reason that the people must suffer the hardships of their own decision.

When a close acquaintance who used to sing praises for the Imperator began to say , "Things are slowly declining," I said, "Didn't you say that the people were not affected by your choice? Besides, this is just the beginning. The good days are still ahead!" But he would only say, "The intention of the top leader is good, but the implementation by inferior officers is bad. Then there are some sickening words like "people with foreign conspiracy," "malicious use," "rare cases." These people, as Tiberius said, are really minions. (translated by {baron} 2023 Mar.14)
