吾友养猪，请吾观之，至猪圈，有感慨，临栏而叹曰：“於戏！猪生甚苦哉。食沤烂，寝泥坑，且受制于猪倌，生育尚不由己，唯仰市场行情矣。此生何乐之有！”

猪闻我言，抬头对曰：“诚如君言。虽然，我辈每日所劳不过食寝而已，君之所烦事几何？夫我辈受制于猪倌，产崽不得自由，而君受制于律、策、术、令，得自由乎？此非孟子喻梁惠王之故事乎？”

猪语毕，吾泪下。友亦涕，急令杀此猪。

I have a friend who keeps pigs. One day, he invited me to visit the pigsty. In front of the pigs, the picture of them shocked me and I cried, "O! the life of pigs sucks! What they eat is rubbish and they sleep in mud. No freedom in mating or reproduction. All of them are just toys and slaves of pigkeepers. Is there any happiness in their life? "

A pig raised its head and said , "Correctly. But what makes us anxious is only above, what about yours? We are toys of pigkeepers while you are slaves of laws and govornment. You also have no freedom. This is like the fabula of Hui King of Liang and Mencius."

After hearing its words, I could no longer withhold my lacrimation, and neither could my friend. Instantly he urged the pigkeeper to slaughter that pig promptly.
