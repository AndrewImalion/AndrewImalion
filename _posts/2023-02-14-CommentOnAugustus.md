When I was a child, Augustus is just a distant "king" in the Bible. When I was a pupil, Augustus is a stereotype character in our history textbook. When I was an adolescent, he is a demon, imperator who brought my loving Roman Republic into ruin.

And eventually when I become who I am now, Augustus also develops into a solid man in reality, who has ambition, vice yet emotion.

Through this scheme, I despise him, scold him then try to understand him. I learn his life, read his words, finally now, I KNOW him, even though we had never met flesh in flesh and he could never know me as I do about him.
Tandem, "Gracias ago, Gaius."
